#meetups

Technologies that I used in the app:

-Next.js

-MongoDB

-CSS Modules

This is application 
where you can render a list of meetups, 
add meetups and then display 
individual meetup data,
and that data is stored in an actual database.
I write the code for communicating
with that database by using the powerful features 
NextJS offers.
